To compile my code, use the command "make" to create the executables

To run diskinfo use "./diskinfo (Image file)"
To run disklist use "/.disklist (Image file)"
To run diskget use "./diskget (Image file) file"
To run diskput use "./diskput (Image file) file"

Note diskget and diskput have run with segmentation faults but they do still successfully execute from my testing.
