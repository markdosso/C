Please run the makefile using the command "make". This will make the binary file ACS to run which can be run with the command "./ACS [Inputfile]" where [Inputfile] is the file that you will be using to simulate.

The input file that I have included with this zip folder is the test.txt file

I have included the design document with this zip folder in the file Design.txt

I have noticed that occasionally that not all 4 clerks work, and sometime only three clerks work but I think that I haved fixed it but if there are only 3 or clerks working at a time please run the program again and it should fix it.
